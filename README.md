# SafetySwarm
React Native Mobile App

Safety Swarm is an app I developed for a 4 day hackathon. 

It allows users to send alerts to nearby users for social assistance in uncomfortable situations such as street harassment.

The app was developed using React Native and utilizes a separate Node.js, Express, Postgres, PostGIS server.

Safety Swarm also utilizes the Google Maps API and Google Firebase FCM for notifications. 

The server for use with the app is located at https://github.com/galxzx/swarm-server
